When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    - to share project publicly
    - access to files remotely
    - backup of project incase of disaster

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    - allows work to be modularised
    - can seperate private from public work

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    - forks are useful to seperate work from others and to give credit to owners of material.
    - cloning allows people to take code from others and make copies of your own projects 
    - branches seperate work within projects into sub sections

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?
