How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
- use git diff commands to see changes with repo and working directory
- commit regularly


What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
