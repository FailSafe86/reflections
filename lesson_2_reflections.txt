What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
- a .git folder is created that contains the history of the git repository
- makes the directory a repository and sets it to the master branch


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
- it is the intermediate between them, acts as a buffer for commits
- allows you to seperate checkpoints
