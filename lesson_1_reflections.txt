How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
- can see changes overtime
- can see areas of difficulty 
- can see time taken on sections


What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
pros:
- can make commits relavent checkpoints basesd on workflow
cons:
- have to remember to commit
- lose work if there is a powercut suddenly


Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
- multiple file commits allow you to see a snapshot of a project or folder where files are related.
- single file commits are useful when each file is independant and do not relate to other files.


How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
- can always revert to other commit stages
- narrow down bug areas
